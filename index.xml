&lt;p>Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,
ché la diritta via era smarrita.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura
esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte
che nel pensier rinova la paura!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tant’è amara che poco è più morte;
ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi trovai,
dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ ho scorte.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Io non so ben ridir com’i’ v’intrai,
tant’era pien di sonno a quel punto
che la verace via abbandonai.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ma poi ch’i’ fui al piè d’un colle giunto,
là dove terminava quella valle
che m’avea di paura il cor compunto,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle
vestite già de’ raggi del pianeta
che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Allor fu la paura un poco queta,
che nel lago del cor m’era durata
la notte ch’i’ passai con tanta pieta.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Policy &amp; Privacy</title><link>https://bxtkezhan.github.io/policy-privacy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2022 21:02:46 +0200</pubDate><author>kk</author><guid>https://bxtkezhan.github.io/policy-privacy/</guid><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://bxtkezhan.github.io/img/default-header-img.tn-500x500.jpg" medium="image" type="image/jpg" width="100" height="100"/><description>&lt;h2 id="privacy-policy-example">Privacy Policy Example&lt;/h2>
