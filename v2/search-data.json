Then come with me to learn 3D modeling with Solidworks. While you learn 3D modeling, I learn how to record and edit small video tutorials. As you can see, it is still an equal exchange. To record the screen I am using OBS and to edit the videos I am familiarazing with DaVinci Resolve.\nMy tutorials are far from perfect and for this reason I would like your criticisms to be also harsh but sincere. I therefore ask you to report any errors or unclear concepts in the comments and I will do my best to improve in the next round.\nIn this series of 5 videos we model a support for a tree consisting of two parts:\nthe lower support the upper shell In the first video we model the lower support and you will learn how to use the 2D Sketch tools and the Extrude and Hole Wizard functions; In the second we model the upper support that I call the shell you will reinforce the use of the tools of the first video.\nIn the third video we will compose the assembly to check if there is any interference between the pieces. In the fourth and fifth video we will prepare the individual pieces on the table. We will learn how to use the Smart Dimension tool, fill in the Title Block and produce the printable sheet in PDF.\nTo follow the first tutorial on Solidworks I suggest you download PDF drawing I created for you. Follow this link and start the exercise:\nDownload\nFile (.pdf)\n1.3 MB\nFollow the next posts to make the other tutorials.\n"

                "body": "This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files.\nThis article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. Let\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!\n:(far fa-bookmark fa-fw): Bookmark this page for easy future reference! 1 Headings Headings from h2 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Heading IDs To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading:\n### A Great Heading {#custom-id} The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;h3 id=\u0026#34;custom-id\u0026#34;\u0026gt;A Great Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; 2 Comments Comments should be HTML compatible.\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\n3 Horizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements. In Markdown, you can create a \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; with any of the following:\n___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks The rendered output looks like this:\n4 Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus.

To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) before task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).\n- [x] Write the press release - [ ] Update the website - [ ] Contact the media The rendered output looks like this:\nWrite the press release Update the website Contact the media 9 Code Inline Code Wrap inline snippets of code with `.\nIn this example, `\u0026lt;section\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt;` should be wrapped as **code**.

For example, each of these chapters:\n## Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. The specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works. 12 Footnotes Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\nThis is a digital footnote[^1]. This is a footnote with \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;[^label] [^1]: This is a digital footnote [^label]: This is a footnote with \u0026#34;label\u0026#34; This is a digital footnote1.\nThis is a footnote with \u0026ldquo;label\u0026rdquo;2\n13 Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or:\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, images also have a footnote style syntax:\n![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Dojocat\u0026#34; LoveIt theme has special shortcode for image, which provides more features.

However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.\nBut this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.\nTo avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown\u0026rsquo;s design philosophy.\nHugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage. These shortcodes are provided for author convenience and to keep your markdown content clean.\n1 figure Documentation of figure\nExample figure input:\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026#34;lighthouse.jpg\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Lighthouse (figure)\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;690px\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} The rendered output looks like this:\nLighthouse (figure) The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;figure\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/lighthouse.jpg\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;figcaption\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;Lighthouse (figure)\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/figcaption\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt; 2 gist Documentation of gist\nExample gist input:\n{{\u0026lt; gist spf13 7896402 \u0026gt;}} The rendered output looks like this:\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;script type=\u0026#34;application/javascript\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://gist.github.com/spf13/7896402.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 3 highlight Documentation of highlight\nExample highlight input:\n{{\u0026lt; highlight html \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;section id=\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Pages }} {{ .Render \u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;}} {{ end }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; {{\u0026lt; /highlight \u0026gt;}} The rendered output looks like this:\n\u0026lt;section id=\u0026#34;main\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1 id=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Pages }} {{ .Render \u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;}} {{ end }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; 4 instagram Documentation of instagram\nInstagram’s API was deprecated since October 24th, 2020 The instagram-shortcode refers an endpoint of Instagram’s API, that’s deprecated since October 24th, 2020.

+ expr) rules = append(rules, rule) fmt.Println(names[i], rule) } 需要注意的是必须为每一个正则表达式头前插入^用来确保匹配的字符串包括最左边的一个字符，避免“跳跃匹配”。\n循环匹配字段: for row, code := range os.Args[1:] { position := 0 col := 0 for true { for position \u0026lt; len(code) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (code[position] == \u0026#39; \u0026#39; || code[position] == \u0026#39;\\t\u0026#39;) { position += 1 col += 1 } if position \u0026gt;= len(code) { break } source := \u0026#34;\u0026#34; tokenType := -1 for i, rule := range rules { source = rule.FindString(code[position:]) if source != \u0026#34;\u0026#34; { tokenType = i break } } if tokenType \u0026gt;= 0 { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%s\\t`%s`\\t%d\\t%d\\n\u0026#34;, names[tokenType], source, row, col) position += len(source) col += utf8.RuneCountInString(source) } else { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;error in: %d, %d\\n\u0026#34;, row, col) break } } } 使用遍历os.Args[1:]的方法将用户输入的每一个参数作为一行代码进行词法分析。\n跳过【忽略】空字符: for position \u0026lt; len(code) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (code[position] == \u0026#39; \u0026#39; || code[position] == \u0026#39;\\t\u0026#39;) { position += 1 col += 1 } 因为我们的正则表达式必须匹配最左边的一个字符所以需要跳过一些常常没有意义的空字符。\n判断是否需要中断循环: if position \u0026gt;= len(code) { break } 遍历匹配规则尝试匹配: source := \u0026#34;\u0026#34; tokenType := -1 for i, rule := range rules { source = rule.FindString(code[position:]) if source != \u0026#34;\u0026#34; { tokenType = i break } } 循环遍历设定的规则进行匹配，如果成功则将下标设定为tokenType的值，如果始终没有匹配则tokenType默认-1。\n根据匹配结果判断后续行为: if tokenType \u0026gt;= 0 { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;%s\\t`%s`\\t%d\\t%d\\n\u0026#34;, names[tokenType], source, row, col) position += len(source) col += utf8.RuneCountInString(source) } else { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;error in: %d, %d\\n\u0026#34;, row, col) break } 如果tokenType不为-1，则匹配成功，将打印字段名称，字面量，行列信息，并且设置position使之跳过当前字段，需要注意下一个字段起始的列号col的增量需要使用utf8的符文计数方法获得，否则遇到一些unicode/utf8编码将无法得到正确指向。\nPython使用者也可以轻松的实现 😁️\nPython词法分析器 import re import sys exprs = [\u0026#39;\\\\d+\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;\\\\w+\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;[\\\\+\\\\-=]\u0026#39;] names = [\u0026#39;INT\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;NAME\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;SYMBOL\u0026#39;] def main(): rules = [] for i, expr in enumerate(exprs): rules.append(re.compile(\u0026#39;^\u0026#39;
