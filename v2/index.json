[{"content":"This is a video post view example.\nDo you, like me, find yourself stuck at home these days and are looking to learn something new? Then come with me to learn 3D modeling with Solidworks. While you learn 3D modeling, I learn how to record and edit small video tutorials. As you can see, it is still an equal exchange. To record the screen I am using OBS and to edit the videos I am familiarazing with DaVinci Resolve.\nMy tutorials are far from perfect and for this reason I would like your criticisms to be also harsh but sincere. I therefore ask you to report any errors or unclear concepts in the comments and I will do my best to improve in the next round.\nIn this series of 5 videos we model a support for a tree consisting of two parts:\nthe lower support the upper shell In the first video we model the lower support and you will learn how to use the 2D Sketch tools and the Extrude and Hole Wizard functions; In the second we model the upper support that I call the shell you will reinforce the use of the tools of the first video.\nIn the third video we will compose the assembly to check if there is any interference between the pieces. In the fourth and fifth video we will prepare the individual pieces on the table. We will learn how to use the Smart Dimension tool, fill in the Title Block and produce the printable sheet in PDF.\nTo follow the first tutorial on Solidworks I suggest you download PDF drawing I created for you. Follow this link and start the exercise:\nDownload\nFile (.pdf)\n1.3 MB\nFollow the next posts to make the other tutorials.\n","description":"Descrizione da rivedere se è un doppione subtitle","tags":["tutorial","solidworks"],"title":"Video Post View","uri":"/v2/video-post-view/"},{"content":"Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ’lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\nWhere does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.\nTo follow along, you can download the code and other resources by clicking the link below:\nGet Source Code: Click here to get the code project as well as snapshots of the individual steps followed in this tutorial.\n","description":"Descrizione da rivedere se è un doppione subtitle","tags":["tag1","tag2","tag3","tag4"],"title":"Post without sidebar","uri":"/v2/post-without-sidebar/"},{"content":"What is Lorem Ipsum?

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!\n:(far fa-bookmark fa-fw): Bookmark this page for easy future reference! 1 Headings Headings from h2 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading The HTML looks like this:\n\u003ch2\u003eh2 Heading\u003c/h2\u003e \u003ch3\u003eh3 Heading\u003c/h3\u003e \u003ch4\u003eh4 Heading\u003c/h4\u003e \u003ch5\u003eh5 Heading\u003c/h5\u003e \u003ch6\u003eh6 Heading\u003c/h6\u003e Heading IDs To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading:\n### A Great Heading {#custom-id} The HTML looks like this:\n\u003ch3 id=\"custom-id\"\u003eA Great Heading\u003c/h3\u003e 2 Comments Comments should be HTML compatible.\n\u003c!-- This is a comment --\u003e Comment below should NOT be seen:\n3 Horizontal Rules The HTML \u003chr\u003e element is for creating a “thematic break” between paragraph-level elements. In Markdown, you can create a \u003chr\u003e with any of the following:\n___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks The rendered output looks like this:\n4 Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cp\u003eLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\u003c/p\u003e A line break can be done with one blank line.\n5 Inline HTML If you need a certain HTML tag (with a class) you can simply use HTML:\nParagraph in Markdown. \u003cdiv class=\"class\"\u003e This is \u003cb\u003eHTML\u003c/b\u003e \u003c/div\u003e Paragraph in Markdown. 6 Emphasis Bold For emphasizing a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as bold text.\n**rendered as bold text** __rendered as bold text__ The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cstrong\u003erendered as bold text\u003c/strong\u003e Italics For emphasizing a snippet of text with italics.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as italicized text.\n*rendered as italicized text* _rendered as italicized text_ The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cem\u003erendered as italicized text\u003c/em\u003e Strikethrough In [GFM]^(GitHub flavored Markdown) you can do strikethroughs.\n~~Strike through this text.~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nStrike through this text.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u003cdel\u003eStrike through this text.\u003c/del\u003e Combination Bold, italics, and strikethrough can be used in combination.\n***bold and italics*** ~~**strikethrough and bold**~~ ~~*strikethrough and italics*~~ ~~***bold, italics and strikethrough***~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nbold and italics\nstrikethrough and bold\nstrikethrough and italics\nbold, italics and strikethrough\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebold and italics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cdel\u003e\u003cstrong\u003estrikethrough and bold\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/del\u003e \u003cdel\u003e\u003cem\u003estrikethrough and italics\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/del\u003e \u003cdel\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebold, italics and strikethrough\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/del\u003e 7 Blockquotes For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.\nAdd \u003e before any text you want to quote:\n\u003e **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. The rendered output looks like this:\nFusion Drive combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u003cblockquote\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eFusion Drive\u003c/strong\u003e combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/blockquote\u003e Blockquotes can also be nested:\n\u003e Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue.

Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.\n8 Lists Unordered A list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter.\nYou may use any of the following symbols to denote bullets for each list item:\n* valid bullet - valid bullet + valid bullet For example:\n* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet * Consectetur adipiscing elit * Integer molestie lorem at massa * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet * Nulla volutpat aliquam velit * Phasellus iaculis neque * Purus sodales ultricies * Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem * Ac tristique libero volutpat at * Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel * Aenean sit amet erat nunc * Eget porttitor lorem The rendered output looks like this:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lorem at massa Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Phasellus iaculis neque Purus sodales ultricies Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem Ac tristique libero volutpat at Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Aenean sit amet erat nunc Eget porttitor lorem The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eLorem ipsum dolor sit amet\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eConsectetur adipiscing elit\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eInteger molestie lorem at massa\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eFacilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eNulla volutpat aliquam velit \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003ePhasellus iaculis neque\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003ePurus sodales ultricies\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eVestibulum laoreet porttitor sem\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eAc tristique libero volutpat at\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eFaucibus porta lacus fringilla vel\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eAenean sit amet erat nunc\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eEget porttitor lorem\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e Ordered A list of items in which the order of items does explicitly matter.\n1.

Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

For example, each of these chapters:\n## Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u003ca id=\"chapter-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u003ca id=\"chapter-2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u003ca id=\"chapter-3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. The specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works. 12 Footnotes Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\nThis is a digital footnote[^1]. This is a footnote with \"label\"[^label] [^1]: This is a digital footnote [^label]: This is a footnote with \"label\" This is a digital footnote1.\nThis is a footnote with “label”2\n13 Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or:\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \"The Stormtroopocat\") Like links, images also have a footnote style syntax:\n![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \"The Dojocat\" LoveIt theme has special shortcode for image, which provides more features.

However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.\nBut this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.\nTo avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy.\nHugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage. These shortcodes are provided for author convenience and to keep your markdown content clean.\n1 figure Documentation of figure\nExample figure input:\n{{\u003c figure src=\"lighthouse.jpg\" title=\"Lighthouse (figure)\" width=\"690px\" \u003e}} The rendered output looks like this:\nLighthouse (figure) The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cfigure\u003e \u003cimg src=\"/images/lighthouse.jpg\"/\u003e \u003cfigcaption\u003e \u003ch4\u003eLighthouse (figure)\u003c/h4\u003e \u003c/figcaption\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e 2 gist Documentation of gist\nExample gist input:\n{{\u003c gist spf13 7896402 \u003e}} The rendered output looks like this:\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u003cscript type=\"application/javascript\" src=\"https://gist.github.com/spf13/7896402.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e 3 highlight Documentation of highlight\nExample highlight input:\n{{\u003c highlight html \u003e}} \u003csection id=\"main\"\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e \u003ch1 id=\"title\"\u003e{{ .Title }}\u003c/h1\u003e {{ range .Pages }} {{ .Render \"summary\"}} {{ end }} \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/section\u003e {{\u003c /highlight \u003e}} The rendered output looks like this:\n\u003csection id=\"main\"\u003e \u003cdiv\u003e \u003ch1 id=\"title\"\u003e{{ .Title }}\u003c/h1\u003e {{ range .Pages }} {{ .Render \"summary\"}} {{ end }} \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/section\u003e 4 instagram Documentation of instagram\nInstagram’s API was deprecated since October 24th, 2020 The instagram-shortcode refers an endpoint of Instagram’s API, that’s deprecated since October 24th, 2020.

\"os\" ) fmt 用于打印输出 regexp 正则表达式 unicode/utf8 统计utf8的符文数量 os 获取用户输入 指定正则表达式和字段类型名称: var exprs = []string{\"\\\\d+\", \"[\\\\p{L}\\\\d_]+\", \"[\\\\+\\\\-=]\"} var names = []string{\"INT\", \"NAME\", \"SYMBOL\"} 创建两个字符串数组分别用于存储正则表达式与对应的字段类型名称。\n初始化字段匹配规则: func main() { rules := []*regexp.Regexp{} for i, expr := range exprs { rule, _ := regexp.Compile(\"^\" + expr) rules = append(rules, rule) fmt.Println(names[i], rule) } 需要注意的是必须为每一个正则表达式头前插入^用来确保匹配的字符串包括最左边的一个字符，避免“跳跃匹配”。\n循环匹配字段: for row, code := range os.Args[1:] { position := 0 col := 0 for true { for position \u003c len(code) \u0026\u0026 (code[position] == ' ' || code[position] == '\\t') { position += 1 col += 1 } if position \u003e= len(code) { break } source := \"\" tokenType := -1 for i, rule := range rules { source = rule.FindString(code[position:]) if source != \"\" { tokenType = i break } } if tokenType \u003e= 0 { fmt.Printf(\"%s\\t`%s`\\t%d\\t%d\\n\", names[tokenType], source, row, col) position += len(source) col += utf8.RuneCountInString(source) } else { fmt.Printf(\"error in: %d, %d\\n\", row, col) break } } } 使用遍历os.Args[1:]的方法将用户输入的每一个参数作为一行代码进行词法分析。\n跳过【忽略】空字符: for position \u003c len(code) \u0026\u0026 (code[position] == ' ' || code[position] == '\\t') { position += 1 col += 1 } 因为我们的正则表达式必须匹配最左边的一个字符所以需要跳过一些常常没有意义的空字符。\n判断是否需要中断循环: if position \u003e= len(code) { break } 遍历匹配规则尝试匹配: source := \"\" tokenType := -1 for i, rule := range rules { source = rule.FindString(code[position:]) if source != \"\" { tokenType = i break } } 循环遍历设定的规则进行匹配，如果成功则将下标设定为tokenType的值，如果始终没有匹配则tokenType默认-1。\n根据匹配结果判断后续行为: if tokenType \u003e= 0 { fmt.Printf(\"%s\\t`%s`\\t%d\\t%d\\n\", names[tokenType], source, row, col) position += len(source) col += utf8.RuneCountInString(source) } else { fmt.Printf(\"error in: %d, %d\\n\", row, col) break } 如果tokenType不为-1，则匹配成功，将打印字段名称，字面量，行列信息，并且设置position使之跳过当前字段，需要注意下一个字段起始的列号col的增量需要使用utf8的符文计数方法获得，否则遇到一些unicode/utf8编码将无法得到正确指向。\nPython使用者也可以轻松的实现 😁️\nPython词法分析器 import re import sys exprs =
